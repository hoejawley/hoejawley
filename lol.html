  LYRICS:
  Marvin walked into a helpless land and wondered lightly am I happy, is this happy
Following the footsteps left by man he stepped to reprimand the mystic who's sadistic
Took a step into the elevator who said guess I'll see you later, don't you worry
Fifteen flights that lasted nights and days that spent without a cent for creatures with their beat shirts
Listening to painted whispered light on top forgotten hill
Next the stranded senate of the white brick house with flowers asked some questions for their story
All feeling now he took his bow and left the stage of time with no answers to no questions
Lonely paperbacks that wanted just a taste of feeling to implode them before living
Tiptoed to that wooden sign that said now take your place in line for happy, this is lovely
Listening to painted whispered light on top forgotten hill
One secondary smile
To go that extra mile
To make me feel today
To make it go away
The chemistry is gone
Taken for a ride
Far away from you
No longer left inside
The actor with his world renowned was thinking ‘bout his last real day of silence, was it over
Or is it just we all think that our answer isn't real it's just a picture of a letter
Bumble mumble make the rounds no matter what you'll seem profound it's useless just to worry
Something normal happens somewhere far away in clouds so please stop thinking this is happy
Listening to painted whispered light on top forgotten hill
One secondary smile
To go that extra mile
To make me feel today
To make it go away
The chemistry is gone
Taken for a ride
Far away from you
No longer left inside
One secondary smile
To go that extra mile
To make me feel today
To make it go away
The chemistry is gone
Taken for a ride
Far away from you
No longer left inside
There're no secrets in the door
Just a moment doing chores
And there's something
And there's something
And there's something
And there's something next to nothing
And there's something
And there's something
But you're gone

  <p> hypothetically if you were to listen to Tally Hall, you would slowly develop a crush on Juno. You wonder why you are attracted to a fictional character made by some kid from Michigan. hypothetically of course. </p>
